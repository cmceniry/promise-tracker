// Mermaid.js interop
// Note: The actual rendering functions are inlined in index.html
// to ensure they're available when the WASM module loads.
// This file is kept for documentation purposes.

// The window.render_mermaid function is defined in index.html
// and called from contract_graph.rs via wasm-bindgen.
